# DiSCALE ‚Äì Google Trends Keyword Analysis

This project explores how people across the world search for different topics on **Google Trends**.  
It‚Äôs not just about plotting charts ‚Äì it‚Äôs about turning search data into **real insights**:  
- Where is a keyword most popular?  
- How has it changed over time?  
- Does it follow a seasonal pattern?  
- Can we forecast its future interest?  
- How do related keywords compare?  

I built this project as part of my **data analytics learning journey** to practice collecting data, analyzing patterns, visualizing results, and building insights that could be valuable for businesses and researchers.
